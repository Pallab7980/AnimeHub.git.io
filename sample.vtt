00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.790
I am afraid to go deep into my mind.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.790
You are doing a good job but I have to say

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.390
that if you do not go deeper then people will not like your work,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.990
so being a human being you are not right for our gathering.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.590
Sometimes I think that if I had written. What would have happened,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.290
but now nothing can be done except expressing regret and those words

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.990
are just an excuse so that I can console myself. That is why I am afraid to go deep into my mind.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.390
I am going to make a delivery, okay go carefully.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.790
I am also going to make a delivery.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.990
Don't eat pizza in the enemy sign, I do not understand. What is the problem with this girl,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.790
I do not have any such intention.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.290
The usual baraat, in fact

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.490
apart from this she has never said anything to me. She probably does not even know me properly. She

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.990
is a strange girl, I also have no special interest in her.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.590
Oh no!

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.990
Where is it?

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.390
There is something that is not right.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.190
What is all this,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.290
you have seen some past incidents of my life, nothing good ever happens by the death of unknown people.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.390
Good morning sir, you have been lying unconscious for 3 days.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.490
Hey you know who you are and why you are here,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.190
it's me. Age

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.790
29 years. I had an accident while chasing a truck,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:18.589
no,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.490
there is no one I can call and tell.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.690
Khach Khach now what is this was another cheap joke?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.190
You are a good person how

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.490
did you know that the driver

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.690
was already dead from a heart attack. How did you notice him. Just

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.890
had good luck. After that they collided with the truck so only you and the driver got hurt.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.490
When I told everything to the manager, he said don't worry about the white house car,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.890
just come back to work.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.290
Hey tell me one thing why do you work there,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:26.090
I have a dream?

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.090
I just want to ask you when you

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.290
tell your dreams to others then you don't feel the fear that what will happen if it doesn't happen,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.090
you don't feel it. I think if you say the same thing again and again then it becomes true.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:53.190
You don't know about it

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.190
because we are not that many girlfriends. I

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.290
will tell him that you have come to your senses strange girls.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.590
Manish Meena Meena has been named Revival.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.890
I am not benefited by this but still I am very much so.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.690
I often go back in time by 1 to 5 minutes.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:28.590
Just before something bad happens where everything is too early,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.790
I try to find things

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:38.590
that do not seem right. As if I have been sent there to stop them. This way I

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.140
am out and about. I am able to stop something bad from happening.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.690
I do stop most accidents from happening,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.690
but often they create problems for me.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.690
Welcome home Chaturmas I went to the hospital

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:18.190
and you were sleeping which was very boring so I came back. You

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:24.190
are not having a headache. I am fine. I was scared. I mean they said that your

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.490
collided with a car. I am going to stay for a few days only. Just now in what happiness

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:37.190
my dear son's head collided with a moving car. I

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.890
told you I am fine and anyway there is no place to sleep here. I have seen the clipping in the cupboard

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.190
. My work will be done. Go to the hotel,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.790
money will be wasted. There I would have given you the hospital fees.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.690
Consider it as the fare for your stay. I am his son. He is 52 years old,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.490
but his memories are still the same.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.390
Satguru, can you wake me up at 3:00,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:09.990
absolutely not. Have you come here to visit? You have come so far and

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.890
I will get bored if I see your face. But it hasn't even been a day since you came here. Now have your food.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.090
Sorry, I took your son's TV,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.390
it's okay. Anyway, the worst thing is that I

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.690
will have to go to the bathroom stealthily at night. You don't need to sneak at night.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.090
you had to do less,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:55.290
you knew that

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:02.890
then what's the big deal.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:10.090
We tried very hard that you don't remember anything about him.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.390
Your life was also in danger in this.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.290
When I was only in speed Kidnapping of children!

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:36.190
of my

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.890
classmates were kidnapped

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:51.890
When I

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.590
was young, a neighbor brother, whom I used to call like this,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.090
used to play with me often. His real name was not like this,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.490
but I used to call him by this name because he always

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.490
used to talk like this, that is, about courage. Do you know

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.290
who is the most popular kid in your class?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.890
Buffer is happy and very good at sports. He talks about what he wants and sometimes when

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:26.690
the mischief gets serious, he also gets serious. Popular people are like this,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:32.190
how about it. I try to beat you in one or two things.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.590
Just do as much as you can and never lose courage.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:43.290
6 months after the children disappeared, June Shivaratri

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:48.190
was arrested. He was Yuki for the crime of serial kidnapping.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.390
You took too much.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.590
Nothing

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.290
, it is too heavy. Can you eat curry?

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.990
The fiber of the earth.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:43.290
After

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:51.090
, what did Ho say that you will definitely keep an eye. You don't find anything strange here.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.290
If I think, you had said something to me once before,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.090
then you were the one who got angry.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.690
What happened, you were looking at me,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:23.390
you are not able to see anything.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:38.490
supernatural

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.690
You believe in

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:46.490
there was no fight. Your name is,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.790
I am making curry. Will you really want yours

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.590
?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.790
Yes, you make maang, why did you sleep,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:17.290
is it not good to eat food

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.590
. That is why I am refusing.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:31.890
You cook food,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.890
no Pandit is doing

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:41.690
what

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:42.990
happened,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.190
what is not,

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:53.190
then you

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.690
are my high school student, boss!

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.190
It's okay, there

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:15.290
is no need to say thanks. Welcome

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.990
home, she only works with me.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.490
Stop looking at her as my future wife. You are crazy,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.590
you and she have a good chance. She said,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:33.990
she respects you and nothing else, that girl

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.190
's yes, by the way Lali D had come. To ask for rent,

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.390
good Satguru, that afternoon in the walking lodge of the supermarket,

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.690
yes what happened,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.290
there was no one there. Am I really joking?

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.590
I remembered

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.490
the one who was kidnapped 18 years ago. That girl was my fault. She

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:23.790
could not be caught. She always stayed alone in the park

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.290
but we both were not friends.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:34.690
I

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.290
saw the cows for the last time.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:46.390
I

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:54.090
wanted to forget that matter forever and Mummy also helped me a lot in calling her.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.090
Bal was written on the net, all for rent, Kartik, there is no doubt that he was surprised.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:17.290
Did you change your decision after seeing me, seeing him, he hid his face. He knew me.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.190
I also know him.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.590
Who could it be?

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.590
Remember that man.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.390
Where is he?

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.590
Hello!

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.290
18 years ago we were wrong,

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:01.890
but I am sure. He has repeated this crime in the same way, nobody

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:07.990
has stopped.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:14.190
I will have to talk to the father-in-law. Now the time has come to talk about this.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.990
Students!

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.490
The enemy has to be told that

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:53.490
do not

00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:00.490
trust yourself

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.390
should

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.090
I am leaving, see you tomorrow, see you tomorrow.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.890
What is your mom making for breakfast tomorrow? Curry, yes, there

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.690
was so much of it that I had to eat it for breakfast too.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:51.990
It was very good. Okay,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.390
okay, we will meet again.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.590
Without mom.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.290
Now what is this mom, what are you doing,

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.390
this is not your hookah-kiddo house. At least keep the door closed.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:50.090
Mom,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.990
answer,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.790
this cannot happen at all, please.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.990
curry

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:16.790
did

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:23.290
you live with me and I wrote to you on PlayStation, you are wrong,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.790
I was not there.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:41.790
What is this,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:47.390
another revival, but where am I after all,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.990
get to know

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.490
,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.290
who is it?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:18.590
1988.
